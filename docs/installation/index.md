# Installation

## Recommended

To get latest versions of `Laravel Lang: Lang`, `Laravel Lang: Attributes`, `Laravel Lang: HTTP Statuses` and `Laravel Lang: Publisher` simplify require the package
using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org): 

```bash:no-line-numbers
composer require --dev laravel-lang/common

Now you can manage localizations:

* Add
* Update
* Reset
* Remove
